# PhishDetector
A chrome extension to detect phishing websites using machine learning algorithm.
Note: the extension built here uses the SVM model that I have trained with the previous dataset. I will further update the extension with the newly trained model.

##Machine Learning Evaluation
For the trained model and training processes keep a check on this repository https://github.com/Nirzak/PhishDetector-Model-Evaluation
